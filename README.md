## Game description:
Attack on Titan: Utopia is a one-player, endless  , tower defense game 
inspired by the hit anime Attack on Titan. The story of the anime
revolves around how titans, gigantic humanoid creatures, emerged one day
and wiped out most of humanity. The few surviving humans fled and hid
behind 3 great walls that provided safe haven from the titan threats. Wall
Maria is the outer wall, Wall Rose is the middle wall and Wall Sina is the
inside wall.
This game takes place in an imaginary scenario where the titans breached
their way throughout Wall Maria and reached the northern border of Wall
Rose at the Utopia District. The human forces stationed in Utopia engage
the titans in battle for one last hope of preventing the titans from
breaching Wall Rose. The humans fight by deploying different types of
Anti-Titan weapons in order to stop the Titan’s onslaught and keep Utopia’s
(and Wall Rose’s) walls safe.

## Implementation:
– Through the first milestone, created the classes and variables which represent the titans, the weapons , the walls and
etc... by a java code.
– Through the second milestone, created the methods that represent the actions that occur while playing the game by a
java code.
– Through the third milestone, implemented the graphical user interface (GUI) of the game by a java code and used scene
builder.
– Java OOP features were essential to implement this project

## Project grading:
The project was given a grade of A+

## Gameplay:
